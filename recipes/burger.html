        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb ground beef (80% lean, 20% fat)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>4 burger buns</li>
            <li>Optionals</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Lettuce leaves</li>
                <li>Tomato slices</li>
                <li>Onion slices</li>
                <li>Pickles</li>
                <li>Cheese (American, cheddar, or your choice)</li>
                <li>Ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the patties:</strong> Divide the ground beef into 4 equal portions. Shape each portion into a patty about 1/2 inch thick. Use your thumb to make a small indentation in the center of each patty to prevent it from puffing up while cooking. Season both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the patties:</strong> Heat a grill or skillet over medium-high heat. Place the patties on the grill or in the skillet and cook for about 3-4 minutes per side for medium, or longer if you prefer them more well-done. Add cheese slices during the last minute of cooking, if desired, and let it melt.</li>
            <li><strong>Toast the buns:</strong> While the patties are cooking, slice the burger buns and toast them lightly on the grill or in a separate pan for 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Assemble the burger:</strong> Place each cooked patty on the bottom half of a toasted bun. Top with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, and cheese, if desired. Spread condiments like ketchup, mustard, or mayo on the top bun.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Close the burger with the top bun and serve immediately with your favorite side, like fries or a salad. Enjoy!</li>
