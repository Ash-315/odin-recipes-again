        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Macaroni is a classic type of pasta that originated in Italy, characterized by its short, curved tubular shape. It is made from durum wheat semolina, which gives it a firm texture and a slightly yellow hue. Macaroni is versatile and widely used in various dishes, from baked casseroles to soups, or simply served with sauce. Its small size and shape allow it to absorb flavors and hold onto sauces well, making it a favorite in many kitchens around the world.</p>

        <p>The most popular dish featuring macaroni is macaroni and cheese, where the pasta is paired with a creamy, melted cheese sauce. This comfort food has become a staple in many homes, often enjoyed by both children and adults. However, macaroni is also commonly used in pasta salads, soups, and Italian-inspired casseroles, making it a beloved and adaptable ingredient in countless recipes. Whether it's part of a hearty meal or a simple side dish, macaroni continues to be a go-to pasta choice globally.</p>
