        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Ramen is a beloved Japanese noodle soup known for its rich, savory broth and chewy wheat noodles. Originally inspired by Chinese cuisine, ramen has become a staple in Japan, with numerous regional variations. The dish typically consists of a flavorful broth, ranging from light soy sauce-based (shoyu) to creamy pork bone broth (tonkotsu). It is often topped with a variety of ingredients like tender slices of chashu pork, soft-boiled eggs, green onions, and seaweed, creating a balanced and satisfying meal.</p>
        <p>Each bowl of ramen offers a unique depth of flavor, depending on the broth and seasonings used. The noodles, cooked to the perfect texture, absorb the broth's umami taste, making every bite enjoyable. Ramen can be customized with spicy seasonings, butter, or even corn, depending on regional preferences. Whether served in bustling ramen shops or prepared at home, this comforting dish remains a favorite worldwide, enjoyed for its warmth, complexity, and deliciously layered flavors.</p>
